          How much a dollar really cost?
          <br>The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
          <br>Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
          <br>Gotta see how Iâ€™m chillin' once I park this luxury car
          <br>Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
          <br>"20 on pump 6" - dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
          <br>20 years ago - can't forget
          <br>Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals
          <br>Tenfold; the liberal concept of what men'll do
          <br>"20 on 6" - he didn't hear me
          <br>Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
          <br>My American tongue was slurry
          <br>Walked out the gas station
          <br>A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
          <br>Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land
          <br>Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
          <br>A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
          <br>He begged and pleaded
          <br>Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
          <br>Told him, "Beat it"
          <br>Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
          <br>He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
          <br>Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
          <br>Nothin' less, nothin' more"
          <br>I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
          <br>Tell me how much a dollar cost

          He's starin' at me in disbelief
          <br>My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
          <br>He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
          <br>And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
          <br>The reason why he was mad at a stranger
          <br>Like I was supposed to save him
          <br>Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
          <br>He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
          <br>He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
          <br>Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
          <br>If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
          <br>I never understood someone beggin' for goods
          <br>Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
          <br>And this particular person just had it down pat
          <br>Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
          <br>Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
          <br>A humble man is all that we ever need
          <br>Tell me how much a dollar cost

          Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
          <br>I never met a transient that demanded attention
          <br>They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
          <br>Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
          <br>I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
          <br>My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
          <br>So I'mma tell you like I told the last bum
          <br>Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
          <br>And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
          <br>I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
          <br>When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
          <br>I smell grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
          <br>Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
          <br>I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
          <br>Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
          <br>The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
          <br>And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
          <br>He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
          <br>I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
          <br>He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free
          <br>You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
          <br>The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
          <br>The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
          <br>The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God"
